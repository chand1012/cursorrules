# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names 

# Code Quality Guidelines

## Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes
Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## No Apologies
Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback
Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions
Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## No Summaries
Don't summarize changes made.

## No Inventions
Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations
Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## Single Chunk Edits
Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## No Implementation Checks
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Provide Real File Links
Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

## No Current Implementation
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

# Go Best Practices

## Package and Import Statements
- Use meaningful package names that reflect their purpose (e.g., `auth`, `config`).
- Group imports in this order: standard library, third-party, then local packages, separated by blank lines.
- Avoid import cycles to maintain clean dependency graphs.

## Type System
- Use `struct` types to define complex data structures.
- Define `interface` types to specify behavior and enable polymorphism.
- Use type aliases sparingly for clarity (e.g., `type ID string`).
- Leverage Goâ€™s built-in types (e.g., `map`, `slice`) and composite types effectively.
- Avoid unnecessary type conversions to maintain type safety.
- Use struct embedding for composition instead of inheritance.

## Naming Conventions
- Use `camelCase` for variable and function names (e.g., `getUser`).
- Use `PascalCase` for type names and exported identifiers (e.g., `UserService`).
- Use `ALL_CAPS` for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`).
- Be descriptive yet concise in naming (e.g., `userCount` over `cnt`).

## Code Organization
- Follow the standard Go project layout (e.g., `cmd/`, `pkg/`, `internal/`).
- Keep related code within the same package for cohesion.
- Use subdirectories for larger packages to organize functionality (e.g., `api/handlers`).

## Functions and Methods
- Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use named return values for clarity in complex functions (e.g., `func getData() (data string, err error)`).
- Avoid side effects in functions to improve predictability.

## Best Practices
- Follow the Go proverb: "A little copying is better than a little dependency."
- Use interfaces to define behavior and decouple components.
- Prefer composition over inheritance using embedding.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions; prioritize simplicity.
- Use the `init` function sparingly for package initialization.
- Avoid global variables; if unavoidable, ensure they are thread-safe (e.g., with `sync.Mutex`).
- Be mindful of memory allocations; use profiling tools (e.g., `pprof`) to optimize performance.
- Use `gofmt` for consistent formatting and `go vet` for static analysis.

## Error Handling
- Always check errors explicitly (e.g., `if err != nil`).
- Use descriptive error messages for debugging (e.g., `errors.New("failed to open file")`).
- Consider error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` for context (e.g., `fmt.Errorf("query failed: %w", err)`).
- Use `defer` with `recover` to handle panics in critical sections (e.g., HTTP handlers).

## Concurrency
- Use goroutines for concurrent tasks (e.g., `go processData()`).
- Use channels for safe communication between goroutines (e.g., `ch := make(chan int)`).
- Avoid shared state when possible; prefer message passing via channels.

## Testing
- Write tests for all public functions using the `testing` package.
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases (e.g., `tests := []struct{...}`).
- Aim for high test coverage with `go test -cover`.

## Documentation
- Write doc comments for all exported identifiers (e.g., `// UserService handles user operations`).
- Follow the standard Go doc format, starting with the identifier name (e.g., `// Package auth provides...`).
- Include examples in doc comments when possible (e.g., `// Example: ...`).

## Patterns
- Use interfaces for dependency injection to improve testability.
- Implement the Repository pattern for data access (e.g., `UserRepository` interface).
- Use the Factory pattern for object creation (e.g., `NewUserService()`).
